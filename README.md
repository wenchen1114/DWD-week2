I chose Spanish Designer Quim Marin's work, and analyze it on figma. Through making grid and calculating the distance, I am able to understand her design and arrangement. For the content, I decided to continue my work about Boba tea last week, and designed a immersive digital chewing party at my favorite boba tea shop, BOba Guys near old ITP.
