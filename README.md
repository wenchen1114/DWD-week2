# Design Process

I chose Spanish Designer Quim Marin's work, and analyze it on figma. Through making grid and calculating the distance, I am able to understand her design and arrangement. For the content, I decided to continue my work about Boba tea last week, and designed a immersive digital chewing party at my favorite boba tea shop, Boba Guys near old ITP.

I decided to keep the circle in the center right, and to add more futuristic element in it, I designed a wave and cut it in half-circle.

# Website Process
I first design the arrangement of the website, to accomodate the different sizes of objects on my page, I decide to make it in four columns and four rows. I then set the width and height of each area, put words into it. About the div arrangement, my friend, Vince, suggested me to wrap all the area with another div, so as to make the arrangements more stable.

During putting the design onto the website by CSS, I found it a bit hard to just follow the analysis to build it. Because the font is designed with some space, so when the text becomes bigger, the more space it would leave on the top. So I use margin-top to adjust it, but still feel struggled about the aligning of combination from different size of fonts. Also, I tried to use mask on the SVG image I made, but it gign't work. I have no choice but making object in illustrator beforehand.
